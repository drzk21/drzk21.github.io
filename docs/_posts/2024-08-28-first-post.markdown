# Definitions

This page will serve as a glossary for my posts. I will do my best to provide clear definitions of the terms I use. I will update this page for new terms and clarifications on existing terms.

## Post-AGI
"Post-AGI" means "after development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)." There are many possible definitions of AGI, but what I mean here is something like human-level AGI, i.e., AI that can do everything that a reasonably intelligent human could do (including the ability to learn virtually any human skill) at least as quickly as a human. I am further assuming that the cost of using one of these AIs to do any job or task will be lower than the cost of employing an equally skilled human to do the same job/task.

In other words, it should be assumed that for any job, there would be no reason to hire a human being to do the job over an AI, other than pure preference that a human do the job. (This is why I say "lower" rather than "lower than or equal to" because if the cost is merely equal, there would not be a strong reason to use AI over human labor.) Lastly, I am assuming that most jobs will be done by AIs, especially as the cost of "employing" AIs continues to fall and training them becomes faster. For example, it's hard to justify continuing to spend 10+ years training human doctors and then paying them six-figure salaries if you can clone an AI doctor with encyclopedic medical knowledge for, say, a couple thousand dollars in a few hours.
